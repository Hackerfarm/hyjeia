Hyjeia is named after Hygeia, the goddess of cleanliness, and is an open source room-scale decontamination control system using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). It's based on the [protocol established by Nebraska Medicine](https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf) when they created their biocontainment unit to deal with the Ebola outbreak. This system is designed to be an open source replacement for the UVGI equipment used in the protocol.
